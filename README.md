# WW_DictionaryTask
Java code to check if file exists and if exists print its words with meanings.  

I am using two files to support our functionality:
Data.properties: This file provides different path available to be checked and allows us to change path as per requirements.
Dictionary.txt: This text file contains test data to be retrieved and returned as per requirements.

To run test:
run dictionary.java file
